description: Layer an N-way capability classifier (Arch-Router 1.5B on your own Ollama) onto the LiteLLM router — shadow mode first, then flag-gated live routing via a virtual 'auto' model. Every request through the router gets classified against operator-defined capability routes (code / reasoning / general / …) and logged; only requests explicitly naming 'auto' are ever rewritten. The base for the confidence floor and Claude escalation (llm-router design §16). Use when the user wants prompt-aware model routing or to start collecting routing data.

# Add routing (capability classifier over LiteLLM, shadow-first)

Implements the classifier tier of
[docs/webchat/design/llm-router.md](../../../docs/webchat/design/llm-router.md) §16b: an
**Arch-Router 1.5B** route-classifier running on your own model server maps
each prompt to an operator-defined **capability route** (name + English
description), each route **bound to a roster model**. This skill installs it
in **shadow mode**: every completion through LiteLLM is classified and logged,
**nothing about the request changes** — zero risk, and the log calibrates the
later live phases (virtual `auto` model, confidence floor, Claude escalation).

Depends on **`/add-litellm`** (the router must be installed). Layered exactly
per its "For dependent skills" contract: this installer re-runs the container
with extra mounts, superseding the base run.

## Prerequisites

1. `/add-litellm` installed and healthy (`curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/models`).
2. **Arch-Router on an Ollama you control** (a ~1GB GGUF; fits beside any
   existing model):

   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST http://<classifier-host>:11434/api/pull \
     -d '{"model":"hf.co/katanemo/Arch-Router-1.5B.gguf:Q4_K_M","stream":false}'
   ```

## Install

```bash
bash .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/install-routing.sh \
  [--port 4000] [--name nanoclaw-litellm] [--image <litellm-image>]
```

Idempotent. It seeds `data/litellm/routing/routes.json` **once** (then never
overwrites — it's operator-owned), refreshes the skill-owned
`data/litellm/router_hook.py`, wires the callback into `config.yaml`, and
recreates the LiteLLM container with the routing mounts. **After seeding, edit
`routes.json`**: set the classifier host and bind each route to a roster model,
then re-run the installer.

> Ordering note: re-running the `/add-litellm` installer regenerates
> `config.yaml` and recreates the container **without** the hook — re-run this
> installer afterwards to restore it. (Roster changed? add-litellm first, then
> this.)

## Tuning — the whole game is route descriptions

The classifier matches the user's latest intent against each route's English
`description`. Improve routing by editing descriptions, not code — e.g. if
debugging prompts land on `reasoning`, sharpen `code`'s description ("…
including diagnosing errors, stack traces, and unexpected behavior") or split
a dedicated `debugging` route. Finer-grained routes classify better than broad
ones. Prompts matching nothing return route `other` → logged with the
`default_route` binding.

## Verify

```bash
# hook unit tests (inside the LiteLLM image — the host doesn't carry litellm/httpx)
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/.claude/skills/add-routing/resources:/t:ro" \
  --entrypoint python ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:v1.90.0 \
  -m unittest discover -s /t -p 'test_*.py'

# end to end: one request through the router, then the decision it logged
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:4000/v1/chat/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"<a-roster-model>","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"write a bash one-liner"}],"max_tokens":10}' >/dev/null
sleep 3; tail -1 data/litellm/routing/routing-shadow.jsonl
```

A healthy line: `{"ts":…, "requested_model":…, "route":"code", "bound_model":…, "ms":~750}`.
`"route":"__error__"` lines mean the classifier was unreachable (host asleep,
timeout) — by design the request itself was unaffected.

## Shadow-log review (what to look at before going live)

- **Agreement**: does `bound_model` usually match what you'd have picked?
- **`other` rate**: high → your routes don't cover real traffic; add/reword.
- **`__error__` rate**: high → classifier host availability; move it or accept
  the default-route fallback for the live phase.
- Warm classify latency (`ms`) sets the live-phase timeout budget.

## Going live — the virtual `auto` model (Phase 2)

When the shadow log looks right, enable live routing in `routes.json`:

```json
"live": { "enabled": true, "model_name": "auto", "timeout_ms": 5000 }
```

No installer re-run needed — the hook re-reads `routes.json` per request.
Semantics:

- A request whose model is exactly `live.model_name` (`auto`) is classified
  **synchronously** (adds one warm classify, ~750–1000ms) and rewritten to the
  matched route's bound model before LiteLLM picks a deployment.
- **Fallback, never failure**: classifier unreachable / timeout / bad JSON /
  route `other` or unknown → the request runs on the `default_route` binding.
  `live.timeout_ms` (default 5000) bounds how long a request can wait on the
  classifier — keep it tight; the fallback is always available.
- Requests naming a **concrete roster model are never rewritten**, flag or no
  flag. Shadow logging continues for them unchanged.
- Every live decision is logged to the same JSONL with `"mode":"live"` and a
  `final_model` field — `grep '"mode": "live"'` to audit what `auto` did.

`auto` is not in LiteLLM's `model_list` — it exists only while the hook is
loaded. If `/add-litellm` is re-run (which drops the hook wiring), requests
for `auto` fail with model-not-found until this installer is re-run. That's
deliberate: loud, not silently unrouted.

To expose it in the webchat Models tab, register a model with kind
**openai-compatible**, endpoint `http://host.docker.internal:4000/v1`, model
id `auto` — assigning it to an agent group behaves like any other
openai-compatible model (the group runs on the default Claude harness, which
reaches the router through LiteLLM's Anthropic `/v1/messages` surface; each
turn's model is picked per prompt).

## Multiple routers — reusable routing profiles

One `auto` is the simple case; you can define several named routers (routing
profiles), each with its own routes and bindings, all sharing the one
classifier and the one roster. An agent picks its behaviour by which virtual
model it's assigned — same `:4000` endpoint, different name (`auto`,
`auto-vision`, `auto-cheap`, …).

The multi-router `routes.json` shape:

```json
{
  "classifier": { … },              // shared — one Arch-Router
  "live": { "enabled": true },      // global kill-switch
  "routers": {
    "auto":        { "default_route": "general", "timeout_ms": 8000, "routes": [ … ] },
    "auto-vision": { "default_route": "general", "timeout_ms": 8000, "routes": [ … ] }
  }
}
```

The pre-multi-router shape (top-level `routes`/`default_route`/`live.model_name`)
still works — the hook, binder, and recalibration read both. To move to the
map so you can add profiles, run once:

```bash
node .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/migrate-routes-multi.mjs   # [--dry-run]
```

It converts your current single router into `routers.auto` (idempotent). Then
add more entries under `routers`, register each name as an openai-compatible
model (as above), and assign. `bind-routes.mjs` binds every router from the
shared roster; recalibration tunes each router's timeout from its own traffic;
decision-log lines carry a `"router"` field.

## Escalation — the confidence floor as a route (Phase 3, §16c)

Arch-Router yields no confidence score, so the floor is realized as an
**escalate route**: a route with `"escalate": true` and **no model binding**
whose description captures work beyond your local roster (the example seeds
one). Live behavior when a prompt classifies there:

- The hook rejects the request **before any generation** with HTTP 400 and a
  `no_adequate_model` marker in the error body.
- The turn fails inside the agent container; if the agent group has a
  **`fallback_provider`** configured, the runner re-runs the turn ONCE on
  that provider with a fresh session (one-shot — a fallback failure never
  re-escalates; the next turn goes back to the primary). The same seam
  catches hard failures: LiteLLM down, backend timeout, dead model.

The `fallback_provider` seam is **not part of trunk** — this skill delivers
it as reversible core-file surgery (same contract as the webchat installer's
hook patches: reverse-check → `git apply --3way` → conflict-restore; new
files copied in). **Prerequisite:** the poll-loop abandoned-query fix
(`fix(poll-loop): abandoned hub queries kept polling`, merged to
`channels-webchat` 2026-07-04) must be in your checkout's history — the
escalation patches build on its `signal` parameter; patch preimages are
pinned to the post-v2.1.38 trunk. A checkout current with `channels-webchat`
has both. Install, then restart the host so the migration runs:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/core-escalation/install-core-escalation.sh
# restart the nanoclaw service, then arm a group:
ncl groups config update --id <group-id> --fallback-provider claude
ncl groups restart --id <group-id>
# clear it again with --fallback-provider none
```

The seam is provider-agnostic core plumbing (migration for the
`container_configs.fallback_provider` column, the `ncl` flag, the poll-loop
one-shot retry, the container-runner env/mount merge for the fallback
provider). Re-running the installer is idempotent; upstream drift is absorbed
by the 3-way apply, and a genuine conflict restores the file and reports
instead of leaving markers.

Classifier failures never escalate — only an affirmative classification does.
Escalation costs fallback-provider quota and double latency; it is a
backstop, not a routine path. Shadow mode logs escalate matches as
`"bound_model": "__escalate__"` so you can tune the route description before
arming a fallback. Without a `fallback_provider`, an escalate match surfaces
to the user as an error — don't add the route until the group has a fallback
(or you want a hard refusal).

## Automatic capability bindings (roster-driven routing)

Routes stay operator-described; the MODEL each route binds to is derived
automatically from the live roster and a capability catalog:

```bash
node .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/bind-routes.mjs          # dry-run decision table
node .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/bind-routes.mjs --apply  # rewrite unpinned bindings
```

`capabilities.json` (skill-owned) profiles model families — per-route quality
0-100 plus a size penalty (`quality − (paramB − max_comfortable_b) ×
size_penalty_per_b`) so an oversized specialist loses to a right-sized one on
modest hardware. Operator layer: `data/litellm/routing/capabilities.local.json`
(same shape, matched first, can raise `max_comfortable_b` on big-GPU hosts).
Rules: pinned routes (`"pinned": true`) and the escalate route are never
touched; descriptions are never touched; unknown roster models are reported,
never auto-bound; a route with no scored candidate keeps its current binding.
Runs automatically after the webchat "Refresh roster…" action and in the
nightly recalibration timer — pull a model, refresh, and it joins routing by
capability on its own.

## Nightly recalibration (Phase 4, §16e tier-1)

Opt-in nightly script over the decision log — no training, no LLM calls:

```bash
bash .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/install-recalibration.sh   # systemd user timer, 03:30
# or run once by hand:
node .claude/skills/add-routing/resources/recalibrate.mjs --days 7
```

What it does each night:

- **Report** (`data/litellm/routing/recalibration-<date>.md`): route
  distribution, classifier error/timeout rate, `other` rate, escalation rate
  as a share of live traffic, classify-latency percentiles — with ⚠ flags
  when a rate leaves its normal band.
- **Auto-tunes ONE knob** (`--apply`, default in the timer):
  `live.timeout_ms` from observed latency (p95 × 1.5, clamped to 2–15s,
  20% deadband so it doesn't thrash). Everything else — route descriptions,
  bindings, the escalate route's aggressiveness — is a recommendation only:
  those are judgment calls, and the whole game is route descriptions.
- **Rotates** log entries older than 30 days to
  `routing-shadow.archive.jsonl` (the rewrite races a concurrent classify
  append in a microscopic window at 03:30 — worst case one shadow line lost).

Arch-Router yields no confidence score, so there is no numeric floor to
recalibrate — the escalation-rate flag is the §16e "escalating 45% but
quality plateaued" signal, pointed at the escalate route's description.

## What this deliberately does NOT do (yet)

The post-flight quality judge (§16d) and router retraining (§16e tier-2) are
later phases and land behind explicit config — never as a side effect of
installing this skill.
