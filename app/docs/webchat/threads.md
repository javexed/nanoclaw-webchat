# Per-room threads (webchat)

Status: **built** — shipped; delivered by the payload overlay like the
rest of webchat. Decisions taken:
**sidebar-nested** thread UI, and **manual-only** thread creation via an inline
"+" affordance (auto-spawn was cut from v1 — see §5). The sections below are the
design; where the implementation differs it is noted inline (notably §5, and
inbound thread_id is bounded — only 'main', a wired-agent lane, or an existing
topic thread routes; an unknown id falls back to main rather than spawning).

A thread starts with no context (its own session). To move conversation between
a thread and the room's regular chat, see
**[thread-context-sync.md](thread-context-sync.md)** (verbatim,
additive pull ↓ / push ↑ with per-thread high-water marks).

## 1. Goal & model

Let one webchat room hold several **independent conversations** with its agent(s),
each with its own context — instead of every message collapsing into one
ever-growing session.

The load-bearing idea: in NanoClaw, **a thread is an agent session.** `thread_id`
is already part of the session key — `resolveSession(agentGroup, messagingGroup,
threadId, 'per-thread')` returns **one session per (room, thread)**, and each
session has its own container context, its own continuation (the Claude
transcript), its own `inbound.db`/`outbound.db`, and its own heartbeat. So a
thread is a real, isolated conversation:

- ✅ topic isolation — no context bleed between unrelated threads
- ✅ smaller per-turn context → cheaper + faster
- ✅ parallel topics with one agent
- ⚠️ **no cross-thread awareness** by design — the agent answering in thread A
  cannot see thread B (different session). This is the point of threads, but it
  must be stated plainly in the UI.

The rejected alternative — threads as a pure UI grouping over one shared session
— reintroduces the context bleed threads exist to remove and fights the session
model. Not pursued.

## 2. What already exists vs. net-new

**Already there (the spine — reused, not built):**
- `thread_id` columns on `sessions`, `messages_in`, `messages_out`,
  `pending_questions`.
- `per-thread` session mode + `resolveSession` keying (`src/session-manager.ts`,
  `src/db/sessions.ts`).
- Router session resolution reads `event.threadId`; `evaluateEngage(...)` already
  receives `threadId` (`src/router.ts`).
- The adapter contract already carries threadId both ways:
  `onInbound(platformId, threadId, message)` and
  `deliver(platformId, threadId, message)` (`src/channels/adapter.ts`).
- The agent's reply is auto-stamped with its session's `thread_id` on every
  outbound row (`writeSessionRouting`, `src/session-manager.ts`).
- `pending_questions.thread_id` — approvals/`ask_user_question` already
  thread-aware.

**The gap we closed — before this feature the webchat skill severed the thread
at both ends** (now fixed; kept here as design motivation):
- The adapter declared `supportsThreads: false` and nulled out the threadId on
  `onInbound`, so every room message collapsed into one `shared` session. Now
  `supportsThreads: true` and inbound carries the real threadId (`index.ts`).
- `deliver` ignored the threadId on the way back. Now it honors it (`index.ts`).
- `webchat_messages` was a flat `(room_id, created_at)` log — **no thread
  column**. Now it has `thread_id` (§3).
- The client had no thread concept; it sent `{type:'message', content}` with no
  thread. Now every frame carries `thread_id` (`app.js`).

So the work is: **stop nulling the thread, store it, route replies back to it,
and give the client a sidebar thread tree.** The routing layer already knows what
to do with a `thread_id` once it is present.

## 3. Data model

Three additions (one new table, one column, one widened key) via a webchat
migration (idempotent, additive):

```sql
-- Thread registry. thread_id becomes session.thread_id for this room.
CREATE TABLE webchat_threads (
  room_id    TEXT NOT NULL,            -- messaging_groups.platform_id
  thread_id  TEXT NOT NULL,            -- 'main' | 'agent:<folder>' | uuid
  title      TEXT NOT NULL,
  kind       TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'topic',  -- 'main' | 'agent' | 'topic'
  created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  updated_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (room_id, thread_id)
);

-- Per-thread message history. Default 'main' migrates existing rows cleanly.
ALTER TABLE webchat_messages ADD COLUMN thread_id TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'main';
CREATE INDEX idx_webchat_messages_thread ON webchat_messages(room_id, thread_id, created_at);

-- Per-thread read markers (widen the existing (user_id, room_id) PK to include thread).
-- New table + copy, since SQLite can't alter a PK in place.
CREATE TABLE webchat_thread_reads (
  user_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
  room_id      TEXT NOT NULL,
  thread_id    TEXT NOT NULL,
  last_read_at INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, room_id, thread_id)
);
```

`thread_id` namespacing:
- **`main`** — every room's implicit default thread (see §7). Created lazily.
- **`agent:<folder>`** — a per-agent lane. Deterministic id so repeated use of
  the same agent reuses the same thread/session. This id shape still exists and
  can be created/used; it just isn't auto-suggested (auto-spawn was cut — §5).
- **`<uuid>`** — a manually-created topic thread.

## 4. Routing flow (the round trip)

**Inbound** (client → agent), example: you send "draft the Q3 roadmap" with the
*Q3 planning* thread selected (`thread_id = u_a1b2`):

1. Client sends `{type:'message', content, thread_id:'u_a1b2'}` (new field).
2. `ws.ts` resolves it and the adapter calls
   `onInbound(roomId, 'u_a1b2', message)` — **passing the thread** instead of null.
3. Router `resolveSession(group, room, 'u_a1b2', 'per-thread')` → session **S1**,
   keyed to that thread. Message lands in **S1's** `inbound.db`; container spawns.
4. `webchat_messages` row stored with `thread_id='u_a1b2'`.

**Outbound** (agent → client):

5. The agent answers in S1; its outbound rows are stamped `thread_id='u_a1b2'`
   automatically (session routing).
6. Delivery calls `deliver(roomId, 'u_a1b2', msg)`; the adapter now **broadcasts
   the threadId** in the WS payload (today dropped).
7. Client renders the reply **inside the Q3 planning thread** and bumps the
   per-thread unread badge for anyone not viewing it.

A second thread (*Incident #4821*, `thread_id=u_c3d4`) keys a **different**
session S2 with zero knowledge of S1 — the agent works both in parallel, each
reply routed to its own thread.

## 5. Auto-spawn — REMOVED (deferred)

Auto-spawn (per-agent lanes via a confirm-first suggestion) was **cut from v1**.
It does **not** ship.

What was removed: the frontend suggestion banner ("Continue with @X in its own
thread?"), the `thread_suggestion` WS emit, the `suggestAgentThread` /
`getRoomAutoThread` / `setRoomAutoThread` backend, and the
`GET/PUT /api/rooms/:id/auto-thread` endpoints. The only residue is a **dormant
`auto_thread` column** left in the migration — additive, unused, harmless.

Threads are created **manually only** — via the inline "+" affordance in the
sidebar (§6). The `agent:<folder>` thread *id shape* still exists and a lane can
be created and used by hand; it just isn't auto-suggested. Auto-spawn may be
revisited in a later release.

## 6. Sidebar-nested UI (decision)

Threads render **nested under their room** in the left sidebar (matches the
multi-thread scaling of the reference implementation), not as a top tab strip.

```
▾ #eng                3   ← room row; number = total unread across its threads
    # main
    @ Sarah            2   ← per-thread unread badge
    @ Max
    # Q3 planning      •   ← manual topic thread (unread dot)
  ▸ #design
  DMs
    Sarah (dm)
```

- Clicking a room expands/collapses its thread list; clicking a thread opens it
  and loads `GET /api/rooms/:id/messages?thread_id=…` (that thread only).
- **Create** ("+ thread" at the bottom of a room's expanded list) → name prompt →
  `POST …/threads` → opens the new (empty) topic thread.
- **Rename / delete** via the thread's row context menu (owner/member rules
  mirror room settings; reuse the room-rename pattern just shipped).
- `agent:*` lane threads (created manually) appear with the agent glyph + name;
  `main` is pinned first and not deletable; topic threads sort by last activity.
- **Unread** is per-thread (`webchat_thread_reads`); the room row shows the sum.
- Active-thread state persists per session (like `lastRoom`).

Follows `public/webchat/DESIGN.md` — tokens, `showToast`, sentence-case microcopy.

## 7. The `main` thread + migration

- Every room has an implicit **`main`** thread (`kind=main`), created lazily on
  first use. A brand-new room with no threads behaves exactly as today — `main`
  is just the room.
- Migration backfills `webchat_messages.thread_id='main'` (column default), so
  **all existing history lands in `main`** with no data loss and no visible
  change until someone creates a thread.
- Existing `webchat_room_reads` rows copy into `webchat_thread_reads` as
  `(user_id, room_id, 'main', last_read_at)`.

## 8. Edge cases & decisions

- **DMs** (`dm:<folder>` rooms): single agent, so they stay single-threaded by
  default. Manual topic threads still allowed if wanted.
- **Engage / mention-sticky** is unchanged — it resolves *within the thread's
  session*, so an engaged agent stays engaged **in that thread**, not across the
  room (matches the reference's per-thread engaged state).
- **Approvals / `ask_user_question`**: `pending_questions.thread_id` already
  exists, so a question from S1 surfaces in its thread and the answer routes
  back to S1. No new work.
- **Delete a thread**: remove the `webchat_threads` row + its `webchat_messages`
  + its `webchat_thread_reads`, and tear down its session dir
  (`data/v2-sessions/<group>/<S>/`). Room + other threads untouched. `main` is
  not deletable.
- **What the agent sees**: only its thread's history. If a user expects
  cross-thread memory, the UI states threads are separate conversations.
- **a2a / loop-back**: agent-authored fan-out keeps its existing self-exclusion;
  it inherits the thread of the session that produced it.

## 9. Build phases (each ends green: typecheck + tests)

0. **Schema + storage** — migration (`webchat_threads`, `thread_id` column,
   `webchat_thread_reads`), thread CRUD helpers in `db.ts`, message read/write
   filtered by thread, read-marker helpers. Backfill `main`. Unit-tested.
1. **Adapter plumbing** — stop nulling threadId on inbound; honor threadId in
   `deliver` + broadcast; drive per-thread session mode for webchat rooms.
   Tests: a message with `thread_id=X` keys a session at X; two threads → two
   sessions; reply routes back to its thread.
2. **Server endpoints** — `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/rooms/:id/threads`;
   `?thread_id=` on the messages endpoint; per-thread read endpoint; thread
   teardown on delete (owner/member-gated, CSRF, mirroring room routes). Tests.
3. ~~**Auto-spawn**~~ — **cut from v1 (see §5)**; only the dormant `auto_thread`
   column remains. Left here for history: it would have redirected a
   single-mention `main` message to an `agent:<folder>` lane.
4. **Sidebar UI** — nested thread tree, create/rename/delete, per-thread history
   load, send-with-thread, route inbound to the right thread, per-thread unread,
   active-thread persistence.
5. **Packaging** — new files ride `payload-manifest.txt` + the migrations
   registration step; the coverage guard proves nothing is dropped.

## 10. Test plan (highlights)

- **Isolation invariant**: messages to thread A and thread B resolve to distinct
  sessions; A's context never appears in B.
- **Round trip**: inbound `thread_id` → session key → outbound stamped → delivery
  threadId → client renders in-thread.
- **History filter**: `?thread_id=` returns only that thread; `main` holds
  migrated history.
- **Unread**: per-thread marker monotonic; room row = sum; cascades on delete.
- **Migration**: existing rooms/messages/reads land in `main` unchanged.
- **Round-trip compose** on a fresh composed install.

## 11. Open questions / risks

- **Client is the riskiest slice** — correctly routing *live* WS messages into
  the right thread node + per-thread unread, without leaking a turn's bubbles
  across threads (reuse `endAllAgentTurns` per-thread).
- **Session sprawl** — many threads = many sessions/containers. Existing idle
  teardown applies per session, so cold threads cost nothing while idle; worth
  watching on busy multi-agent rooms.

## Effort

~1–2 weeks. Almost entirely additive; no change to non-webchat behavior. The
backend is mostly *using* tested machinery; the UI (slice 4) is the bulk of the
new code. Riskiest: live-message routing in the client.
