/**
 * draft_skill MCP tool — the learning loop's authoring surface
 * (see docs/webchat/design/learning-loop.md).
 *
 * When you've just worked out a reusable, non-obvious procedure, call this to
 * DRAFT a skill from it. Fire-and-forget: it writes a `propose_skill` system
 * action; the host stages it as a draft for admin review in the webchat
 * "Proposed skills" surface. Nothing runs in any agent until an admin keeps it.
 *
 * This is authoring only — it can't wire, install, or run anything.
 *
 * UPDATE BEFORE CREATE. A learning loop that only ever *creates* fills the
 * library with near-duplicates: the same lesson, re-learned and re-filed under a
 * slightly different name every time it comes up. The guard is showing the agent
 * what it already has. The tool description below is built at registration time
 * from the skills actually mounted for this session, so the model can match
 * against real names instead of being told to "prefer a patch" over skills it
 * cannot see. The handler then enforces the hierarchy rather than trusting it:
 * a 'create' whose name collides with an existing skill is coerced to a patch,
 * and a 'patch' at a target that doesn't exist is rejected with the valid list.

 *   - the PREFER-EDIT hierarchy — update what exists before creating anything. The
 *     draft_skill tool enforces this (it is shown the agent's real skills and
 *     coerces a colliding 'create' into a patch), but the prompt has to ask for it
 *     too, or the model never reaches for the target.
 *
 * Written as an instruction to the agent that just did the work, in the same
 * session — so the transcript is already in context and there's no cold start.

export const LEARNING_REVIEW_PROMPT = `Review THIS session and decide whether it taught you something worth keeping.

Look for a reusable, non-obvious procedure: a multi-step workflow you worked out, a fix for a tricky error, a correction the user had to make, a verification step that actually caught something.

DO NOT draft a skill for:
- environment-specific failures (a missing binary, a wrong path, a service that was down)
- transient errors that resolved on their own
- "tool X is broken" claims
- a narrative of this one task — a skill is a procedure, not a diary

If nothing here meets that bar, say so in one line and stop. A session that taught you nothing is the normal case, and an empty answer is a good answer.

If something does: call draft_skill. Prefer revising an existing skill (kind='patch') over creating a near-duplicate — you are shown the skills you already have; if the lesson belongs to one of them, patch it and pass the COMPLETE revised SKILL.md.

Write the SKILL.md as: YAML front-matter (name, and a one-line description of the capability), then — When to use / Prerequisites / Procedure (exact commands) / Pitfalls / Verification.

Never invent flags, paths, or APIs. Two sources are trustworthy: what YOU actually ran this session, and what the USER explicitly told you or corrected — a user-stated lesson is ground truth, capture it faithfully. Do not write down anything you merely inferred.

Then reply to the user in one sentence: what you drafted, or that there was nothing worth keeping.`;
