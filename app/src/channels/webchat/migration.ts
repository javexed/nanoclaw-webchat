 *
 * `webchat_mcp_servers` is the registry. `transport` selects the shape:
 *   - 'stdio': command/args/env — a subprocess spawned inside the agent's
 *     container. Defined once here so the same server can be attached to
 *     multiple agents without re-entering it.
 *   - 'sse' | 'http': url/headers — a server reached over the network
 *     (e.g. a tool server on another machine). These are the transports the
 *     host-side probe (POST /api/mcp-servers/probe) can verify before save.
 * `args`/`env`/`headers` are stored as JSON text (sqlite has no array/object
 * column type), matching the mcp_servers JSON column on container_configs.
 *
 * `webchat_agent_mcp_servers` is the assignment join. PK on
 * (agent_group_id, mcp_server_id) — many-to-many, no FK (mirrors

 * surfacing the impact list to the operator).
 *
 * Assign/unassign is an INCREMENTAL upsert/delete against a single key —
 * container_configs.mcp_servers[server.name] — not a wholesale recompute.
 * That matters because `ncl groups config add-mcp-server` writes into the
 * same JSON column directly (a separate, still-supported entry point); a
 * full recompute-from-registry on every assignment change would silently
 * wipe any ncl-added server with a name outside the registry. Incremental
