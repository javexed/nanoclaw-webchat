/**
 * BYOK per-USER credential (central DB) — the connect-time source of truth.
 *
 * A member connects once: their credential lands here as one row per
 * (user, provider), holding the single OneCLI vault `secret_id`. Per-(user,
 * agent-group) enrollment in `byok_credentials` is then created lazily, the
 * first time the member actually uses a given room (see ensureGroupEnrollment),
 * rather than eagerly for every room at connect time. So "connect once" applies
 * to every room — including ones added later — with no per-room proliferation.
 *
 * Migrates existing eager enrollments: any active per-group row with a secret
 * seeds the matching user-level row, so already-connected members stay connected.
